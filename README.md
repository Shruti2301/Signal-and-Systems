# Signal-and-Systems
Implementation of Signals on MATLAB : Beginner to Advanced

## What are Signals?
Signals are all around us, from making a phone call to editing photos.
In Layman's language, a signal is an information conveyed from sender to receiver.

In electronics, a signal is :
> A signal is a source of information, generally a physical quantity, which varies with respect to time, space, temperature like any independent variable.

Classifying signals helps in analyzing, processing, and validating circuits.

## What are Systems?
A System is a physical interconnection of components, or parts, that gathers various amounts of information together.
